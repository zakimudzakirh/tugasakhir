And this one was no different.I abso-fricken-lutely LOVED this book. Even with all the tears that were shed, the story that consumed the book made up for it all.You would have to be crazy to not fall in love with Daniel (Dan). He was amazing through and through, and she was one lucky ass woman. I loved the way he was hired by Cade, and I would have loved Cade as well, just from the things that were said about him. Because he was another great guy.But Daniel took such great care of her and CJ. Not to many men you will find that will do that, when it's another mans baby. But considering what he went through as a child, I think is what made him want to take great care of CJ.Genevieve (Gen) was also another great person, who has went through more than an person should go through within a 2 yr period. Not sure I would handle the things she did, and would still be sane.But she did and even though she doesn't think so, she did it like a champ. She did it the best way she knew how, and making sure CJ was first in everything she did. She handled everything perfect. Even her friends. They were something else by the way.I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to everyone. And always remember that age are just numbers. Because she could have found someone her age, and he probably wouldn't have treated her the way Dan did, are CJ. He was wise beyond his years.As for as the mother. I don't really have any words for her. Although she came around at the end, she still just gets under my skin, with her judging, fancy face self.

There were tear jerking moments, but at times I felt the story was rushed. I loved the older woman/younger man relationship, but I felt that a woman that had been through so much wouldn't let her mother or other outside forces influence her as much as they did.Gen is a strong woman who lost the most precious thing in a tragic way. This all happened when it should have been the happiest time in her life. She made it through on her own. She had Daniel a young man that her husband hired when he was a kid to take care of the lawn and odds and ends around the house. I loved this character. Gen's mother on the other hand I felt was very crass and unsupportive of her daughter. Yes, she wanted the best for her as she should, but she was downright mean and rude to her.Once Gen allowed herself to accept what her heart was telling her she again allowed her mom to intervene and almost ruin everything. At this point, Gen seemed more like a teenager than the woman she was. To me, this didn't mesh. It wasn't that I was rooting for Daniel or for Gen to find a man. I was rooting for Gen to find her strength.Daniel was the most mature character in the book and aside from CJ, he was the youngest.To me, this book isn't what I am used to from HM Ward.

That is until Daniel (Dan the Lawn Man) sparks something inside Gen.Gen's new found feelings are strong but she is concerned what her bossy, know it all mother will think... being 10 years+ older than him, Gen is worried what others will think - but she doesn't even know if Dan likes her in that way. Little does she know...Dan has had a secret crush on Gen since he first started working for her. He's kind, sweet, understanding and best of all, he doesn't judge her. He sees what no one else does - a strong woman who was put through something no one should ever have to go through - left with a baby to raise by herself.

I'm a fan of HM Ward. I enjoy reading fiction, but there's something about a story that every word could happen. I felt like this story could be one that a friend is telling me about another friend.The first part of this story was very personal to me. My brother was deployed in the military. I know the worry and fear a family feels when one of their own is sent to a combat zone. Plus, I'm a mom. Those two things made reading Second Chances so real. I could literally feel Genny's emotions. I cried. I felt anger. I felt confusion. I wanted her mom to just LAY OFF! There is not a time line on grief, although some people feel there should be. I could relate to Genny's mom attire and mom body and insecurities. I loved how her friends were supportive and trying to help her.Again, without spoilers, the crux of the problems in the story were also very real. Family meddles. Emotions flare. Logic and the heart don't always match. Those are REAL issues.

Spoiler free *unless otherwise is specified*.Second Chances is a story about a single mom who lost her husband two years ago. She&#8217;s been in a funk since then, and the only thing she really takes joy in is her son. Pretty quickly we are introduced to her lawn man, Daniel. It&#8217;s clear early on that he likes and cares for Gen and her son, CJ (way more than Genevieve realizes). When Gen is in over her head and is getting frantic, he steppes in. Turns out he&#8217;s pretty amazing with CJ. They find themselves spending more time together. Problem is Daniel is more than 10 years younger than her.'Is he going to kiss me? What the hell is he doing? My stomach flip flops, and when he offers me his boyish grin I melt. &#8220;Genevieve?&#8221;&#8220;Yeah?&#8221; I ask, feeling half drunk with a midlife crisis-mad crush on the lawn boy.&#8220;Can I have the towels, then?&#8221;He&#8217;s been holding out his hand. Oh God, I misread him. I laugh nervously and shove them into his hands, dropping the washcloth on the floor. &#8220;Oh, right! We wouldn&#8217;t want you walking around naked, would we?&#8221;'So this book tackles a pretty taboo topic. There are endless books where the man is a lot older than the woman. No one bats an eye at that, of course. In this book the main character is 33 years old woman and her potential love interest is only 22. He&#8217;s in college. She has a kid. He started working for Gen and her husband when he was fifteen. She&#8217;s now a widow.What I loved was their dynamic. The age difference was non-existent when they were together. He had experienced some things that forced him mature quickly, and so he didn&#8217;t really act like your typical 22-year old.It reminded me the tiniest bit of Seduction & Snacks, especially in the beginning. I loved that book to death, and so I mean that as the biggest complement. In contrast, this book (as we were warned repeatedly) was also a tearjerker.*mini-spoiler, but not really - it brushes upon how much/little sex there is in this book. The rest of the review is completely spoiler free!*This book had a slow burn, and I was actually surprised by the fact that there was only one sex scene, and it took place fairly close to the end. I have to confess I was expecting things to heat up a lot quicker, but that was admittedly before I really got into the book and really grasped the character dynamics.CJ was the adorable. &#62;Dan with CJ&#60; made my ovaries explode. I practically awwwh-ing in any scene they were together.One of my favorite scenes was when Dan was helping Gen out when CJ was sick and she was a train wreck. He took CJ off her hands for a bit so she could shower and take a nap. She was listening to them through the baby monitor. Read this scene and feel your ovaries go boom (if you have them, that is. You could be equipped with cojones for all I know) ;)All in all it was a very entertaining read, and I was laughing out loud several times. It was hilariously written. I think H.M. Ward and Stacey Mosteller was a great match!I had a couple of peeves, which is why I&#8217;m settling on 4.5 stars for this book.

I loved Gen and being a new mom is so hard. Sometimes it's hard to ask for help or even accept the help that is offered to you, because you don't want to feel like a failure. Even though you aren't we all struggle, there is no such thing as a perfect mother.H.M.

Then a few days later she&#8217;s informed that her husband has died. Now she has to raise her son on her own. She never thought it would be so hard. She lives every day trying to do her best. Second Chances is Genevieve&#8217;s story about how she went from surviving to living again with her lawn boy.I&#8217;ve seen a lot of awesome loving reviews for this book and I would love to say I am one of them, but I&#8217;m not. While I LOVE H.M. Ward and her work with all my heart I&#8217;m not going to lie and say I LOVED this book when I didn&#8217;t even though I&#8217;m a huge fan. I enjoyed this book so let&#8217;s get that straight now. I&#8217;m not saying I didn&#8217;t enjoy this book because I did. I couldn&#8217;t tear myself away from the screen as I read for the two hours it took me to read Second Chances even though I was hungry. So I DID enjoy the story I just didn&#8217;t love it.Gen is an enjoyable character to read about. She is a single mom who struggles every day to do everything she can to provide for her son. Meanwhile everyone wants her to move on and go on a date. They want her to find a dad for CJ. Gen struggles with that throughout the book. She is constantly being criticized by her mother and her &#8220;friends&#8221; and by herself. It&#8217;s a constant battle for her.Daniel the lawn boy has been in her life for a long time and when he helps her when she&#8217;s at her lowest she begins to notice him in ways she never has before. He isn&#8217;t the boy who first started working for her when he was fifteen. He&#8217;s all man now and he&#8217;s great with CJ and great with her as well. Daniel&#8217;s all about being her second chance at happiness. Plus Daniel is a total hottie and I mean come on, who doesn&#8217;t want a sexy half-dressed guy pushing a lawn mower in their front lawn? I&#8217;m here to tell you wherever I need to go to sign up for one you let me know asap!So Gen&#8217;s &#8220;friends&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really like all that much. They were critical and total jerks about almost everything Gen did. Also, even though they knew that Gen and her mother don&#8217;t get along they constantly brought the mom over for surprise visits. what the heck ars hats really? And then there&#8217;s the mom. First off I have to say I found it hilarious that the mother reminds me of my grandmother whose last name and also my last name is Hewlett and the mother&#8217;s last name was Howlett. Pretty freaky funny if you ask me. The mother was a beotch no matter which way you spin that. Sorry to those mom fans out there but she was a beotch. She was constantly mocking and rude to Gen and was a manipulative wench about everything. So yeah, no wonder Gen wasn&#8217;t feeling better when she had all these jerks around her all the time to make her doubt herself.Okay so here&#8217;s the thing, I have no freaking idea why I didn&#8217;t love this book more. I have absolutely no idea why I didn&#8217;t enjoy this book except maybe it hit a little too close to home for me. I hated the way she judged herself and how everyone else in her life judged her. It sucked and I honestly couldn't comprehend keeping those people in my life. Actually when I was in that situation I got rid of those people in my life so yeah I didn't see what made them good enough to keep in this book. So sadly I could only give this book 3.5 batty rating if only because the secondary characters relationship and how Gen acted like everything they did was okay pissed me off.Second Chances is beautifully written and it is gut wrenching and hot and beautiful. I think my emotions just weren&#8217;t in this one. So that being said I did enjoy reading  Second Chances. This is definitely an amazing story and I am so happy I got a chance to read it early.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Inspirational", "unixReviewTime": 1405900800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2014"}

I just did not connect with this story or the characters as I would have liked to. Don't get me wrong, I did have all the appropriate responses in all the appropriate places, but something was just lacking for me. I think things were a little choppy at times and just didn't flow as smoothly as I would have wanted. There were a lot of inconsistencies throughout the story that really distracted me and made me lose interest at times. I did not like that at times Daniel was called Dan or that it would just switch back and forth. There really wasn't enough backstory to Daniel until the very end so it made it a little harder to connect with him. Genevieve's character was just too waffling for me, but that is understandable considering what she went through. I just did not LOVE their characters. I did not care for Genevieve's mothers characters personality it too seemed a tad inconsistent especially when she was mentioned in the beginning before deployment. There were just a lot of things that did not fit together for me.Now with all the bad stuff out of the way let me get to the things that I did like.I liked the premise of the story. It was very emotional at times and those scenes were really well written and did draw the appropriate emotions from me. I am not usually one for the older woman and younger man relationships, but this one really worked. Daniels character was so sweet and understanding of Genevieve and her situation that is made up for the lacking parts just a bit. I liked that Genevieve was a very devoted mother considering what she had been through. I did like that Genevieve's friends were there throughout the story and didn't just fall right out of the book. Everything was addressed and nothing left flapping in the wind.Just because this book wasn't a 5 star for me doesn't mean it won't be for you.

This story is as real and heartfelt as they come, and anyone reading this must have some tissues at the ready when they start reading chapter 1. The collaboration between H.M. Ward and Stacey Mosteller in this story is stellar. I've read their stories in the past and both ladies did an awesome job with this one. It broke my heart so many times knowing that many women, and also men, who are married to service men, or women, have gone thru similar situations of loss and love, and come out with new hope and love in their lives.Genevieve is a military wife who can't believe that she has a Chaplain in her home about to tell her that her husband had died. And to top her grief, she didn't get a chance to tell her husband, Cade, that she was pregnant after trying for so long to have a baby. After the baby is born, she dedicates her life to him and feels that she has all she needs, although she is in a continuous funk and always turns down anybody that brings up having her set up with someone.Daniel is the lawn boy that Cade had hired when he was a teenager to work on the yard and help with any repairs while Cade was deployed. After Cade dies, he still continues to take care of things around the house as before. He is young and hot, and Genevieve takes notice of him but put on the breaks at the beginning because he is 11 years younger than she is.When Genevieve sees Daniel take care of CJ and her on one of her low moments, she starts seeing him with new eyes and new emotions arise that lets her know that love didn't die when Cade passed away. But what is she to do with all of it when the person she has become interested in is too young for her?The secondary characters added to the feelings and emotions that Genevieve is going thru in her life. At many points in the story, I couldn't believe the things that her mother said, that I wanted to yell at her myself so she could open her eyes to what she kept saying.Again, this book deals with some real issues and emotions that it made me feel like the story was inspired by true events.

I was crying by page 11. Thankfully the sadness didn't last much longer.At first I wasn't sure if I would like this book due to the age difference.  Yet as I read the book, that worry fell away.  I was then able to enjoy the story of a young war widow trying just to make it through every day. It was very touching and makes you really think about what so many of our young military families are going through.I would recommend that the words &#34;Betrayal and sex&#34; be removed from the book synopsis.  I wouldn't consider what happened to be betrayal at all.  Lack of trust, yes, but not betrayal.  And this isn't a sex filled book by any means.  The amount of sex in this book doesn't justify the word being used.  This book is so different from Ms. Ward's other works and people should know that up front.  However, this is a good thing.

This story has NEVER been done before, at least not that I have read. It was definitely fun reading, even though I knew who it was from the beginning.I do have to give these two four stars. The only reason is that I could sometimes decipher who was writing based on the styles. I know SE Hall&#8217;s writing style pretty well, so I could sometimes tell when it was her, and to me, that took away from the story.But as I said, this story is original. And they alluded to a few classic literature works, some of which I am now interested in learning about. I think that brought a lot to the story, and to the mysteriousness of who the letter writer is.I highly recommend this book to those that love these two writers and to anyone that loves erotic romances.

I am pretty sure that it is vague because the lovely ladies who wrote this crazy good erotic short do not want to spoil it for you.  So, I will not be telling you much about what this book is about because even if I told you the smallest detail it might ruin it for you.  I have read every single S.E. Hall book and Angela Graham book including their two part novella, Stirred Up, (which I loved hard) but nothing quite prepared me for Packaged.I was certainly shocked when I finished Packaged at 1am last night.  It took me a bit to process the fact that I stayed up until 1am devouring a book that I found slightly creepy and little darker than I am used to from two of my favorite authors.  What surprised me even more was how incredibly sexy I found this creepiness.  I am sure you will find yourself feeling the same way; all hot and bothered and even more bothered because your hot.  LOLThe two characters in this book were both very intriguing because, well, I never knew what either one of them were going to do.  Packaged lacks the light heartedness that Stirred Up has but that is in no way a bad thing because it makes up for it with so much sensuality.  It did have some of the hilarity that I expected after reading Stirred Up but, wow, this book was ten times hotter!  So HOT!So, if you are a fan of lots of dirty talk and foreplay, like I am, you will absolutely love this book.  Packaged is a complete novella and although sometimes I find novellas rushed, I did not at all with this book.  It wasn&#8217;t rushed but was deliciously slow; letting me enjoy every stinking detail of the sexy craziness I was devouring.This is an absolute must read, guys!  I cannot say enough good things about it.  It seems that Angela and SE like to have a bit of shock or twist in their books together.

Angela and Steph have done it AGAIN. These bitches are amazing. Seriously. Together they are the Batman and Robin of writing. The dynamic duo for sure. Stirred Up was AMAZING and hot. But Packaged was even hotter and had even more twists and turns and surprises around every corner. It was hot and intriguing from the start. Amelia is getting these love/stalker notes and she starts to reply and then she realizes maybe he isn't all that bad. And then she finally comes face to face with her sinfully sexy stalker. Will he be everything she hoped for and more? can they actually have a shot at a relationship or will certain aspects be too much to over come?It was pure brilliance from the start and I loved every single second of this book.

When S.E Hall and Angela Graham team up for an erotic quickie it is going to be sexy, funny and unique.Since this is quickie book it will be a quickie review....don't want to spoil anything.Amelie has been sought out by an admirer and she has no clue who he could be except he might work in the same building. She is not sure if the letters she is receiving if she should be flattered or scared about but she is intrigued. This mystery man doesn't give much away besides the fact that he knows her and sees her in a different way than others do.She doesn't know what he looks like but there is still some kind of connection. It gets hot and heavy and he is still hiding who he really is. She is so confused since she shouldn't be trusting someone that she knows nothing about except that he makes her feel alive....how can a stranger do this to her?I love this quickie so much!! It was so sexy and I found myself needing to fan myself and that is just from his words. He is sure knows how to get a woman going and knowing that he likes to read is a plus. The mystery and way they communicate is so hot...I can not wait to read Handled.Quotes:&#34;What's vice today may be virtue, tomorrow.&#34; ~ Henry FieldingIt's the most enticing, alarming rollercoaster ride to find myself on and at times, I scare myself t how lost in the overwhelming mystery I delve.Interesting.

Excuse me while I finish fanning myself, it's still a bit hot in here. 5 stars!S.E. Hall is on my list of &#34;I will read anything she writes&#34; authors and I have definitely enjoyed Angela's books before as well. However, novellas make me nervous because I'm not always a fan. You don't get the same character or story development which means an author doesn't have much time to hook you, keep your interest and then satisfy you with the ending.I am very happy to give this novella 5 stars. I was immediately drawn in by the storyline...a shy and somewhat lonely administrative assistant starts receiving letters at work from a mysterious stranger. The longer they go on, the steamier they get.Amelia alternates between being turned on and being creeped out by her 'stalker' but as he gets more bold, she can't deny the sparks that fly when they finally meet. The problem: she still doesn't know who he is. He's determined to keep his identity a secret and after a few super steamy encounters, Amelia feels used and unwanted.Of course there is always another side to the story so her stranger gets a chance to make amends and come clean on his identity. Amelia then has to decide whether she can forgive his behavior and trust him enough to build a relationship.As with all novellas, we don't even know a ton about Amelia or the man in question but we get enough to enjoy them and their story. The writing style is great and in my opinion better than the last novella from Angela and S.E. The dialogue and thoughts are peppered with witty comments. The sex is hot and while there is quite a bit of it, there is a storyline here as well.Packaged is a good length for a novella and an excellent light read. I believe we meet the guy who will star in 'Handled', the upcoming release from these two authors and if I'm right, we're in for another fun ride. The characters from Stirred Up even make a brief appearance here though the stories are completely unrelated. *You do not have to read Stirred Up before Packaged.Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sexy and funny...
